## Description
A digital nomad like myself, or any user with an unstable internet connection can appreciate the need for offline storage.  Especially when it comes to financial purposes!  This budget tracker application allows users to account for the finances regardless of the internet connection.  Thus avoiding overdrafting their account during that...crazy rafting trip or trippy music festival...now transactions can be accounted for at the time of their withdrawal or deposit before we forget!
